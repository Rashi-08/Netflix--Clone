# Netflix--Clone
This is my first projectâ€”a Netflix clone built during a 5-day frontend bootcamp by DevTown. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive UI. It was a fun and hands-on experience that gave me real-world frontend skills and marked the start of my web development journey.
